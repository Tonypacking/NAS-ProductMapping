Using the **PUREPLES** library to use **HyperNEAT** and **ES-HyperNEAT** for evolving neural networks.

More information about the library can be found at [PUREPLES](https://github.com/ukuleleplayer/pureples)

**NEAT** (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving arbitrary neural networks.  
**HyperNEAT** (Hypercube-based NEAT) is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley utilizing NEAT. It is a technique for evolving large-scale neural networks using the geometric regularities of the task domain.  
**ES-HyperNEAT** (Evolvable-substrate HyperNEAT) is a method developed by Sebastian Risi and Kenneth O. Stanley utilizing HyperNEAT. It is a technique for evolving large-scale neural networks using the geometric regularities of the task domain. In contrast to HyperNEAT, the substrate used during evolution is able to evolve. This rids the user of some initial work and often creates a more suitable substrate.

**I did not implement anything in HyperNEAT folder and subfolders. Including hyperneat , es_hypernear algorithms, but rather used the **PUREPLES** library to use hyperNEAT and ES-HyperNEAT for product mapping experiments.**
