# Keras-CoDeepNEAT


Using the **Keras-CoDeepNEAT** for evolving neural networks.

More information about the library can be found at [Keras-CoDeepNEAT](https://github.com/sbcblab/Keras-CoDeepNEAT)



**I refactor the Keras-CoDeepNEAT to be compatible with newer version of Keras Tensorflow  Networkx  PyDot  GraphViz  SkLearn. Version of these packages can be found in [README](README.md)
